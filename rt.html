										<h3 class="major">Background on Ready Tensor</h3>

										<p>
											Ready Tensor Inc. is a machine learning (ML) startup that provides a platform for users to create, edit, and share different
											machine learning models. Users may also download these models which are containerized using Docker which makes them deployable in production settings.
											More information about the company can be found <a href = https://beta.readytensor.com/home target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here</a>. 

										</p>

										<h3 class="major">My Contribution</h3>

										<p>

											During my internship at Ready Tensor, I was responsible for creating a library of containerized machine learning models for two catrgories: binary classification and text
											classification. To be precise, a binary classification algorithm determines whether or not an observation belongs in either one of two classes
											(i.e. if a cell phone is either an Apple or an Android based on some features of the phone). A text classification algorithm is simply the categorization of 
											a corpus of text into a specific category (i.e. would this review be considered a good, bad, or neutral review). The purpose of this library
											was to provide contributing users with a baseline benchmark by which to measure their own models against. Each algorithm I created had to fit within the specified Ready Tensor framework. This included
											providing a data cleaning pipeline, hyperparameter tuning, and a model evaluation output in the Docker
											container.

										
											<br>
											<br>

											Understanding the guidelines I needed to follow, I then was tasked with researching the different
											types of algorithms for each category I was assigned. Listed below are some of the algorithms and tools used to create the library of machine learning models

											Using the proprietary Oura API and packages such as Pandas and Numpy, the backend team was able to extract, transform, and load the Oura data into comma separated value files (CSVs) and store them on a Google Drive. We combined this data with Apple Health data that the bioengineering team was able to extract using the Apple Health API. The frontend team decided to use Tableau as our visualization tool of choice because not only are the graphs very easy to view, but also allow for comments and annotations on the graphs which can be used to document significant life events as per Project Apolloâ€™s request.
											These visualizations would be hosted on a website built using Github pages due to its ability for multiple users to work on the website simultaneously as well as it being free (we are college students after all ðŸ™‚).
											

										</p>

										<h3 class="major">Results</h3>

										<p>After 20 weeks of hard work and late nights, our Longitudinal Integrative Graphical Medical Application was completed. It features five different visualizations that include a Pearson correlation chart that allows the user to see how similar two of the metrics are to one another. We have also linked resources for the user on health information such as diet and sleep to provide them with resources concerning general health. We presented our application at our Data Science Showcase in which many industry professionals and professors inquired about our projects and its impact. 
										</p>

										<h3 class="major">Future Expansions</h3>

										<p>
											As a whole, the project was a success and provided a great starting point for future iterations and improvements. One big improvement we would like to see made going forward would be the automating of the data loading and transformation process. For the sake of this project and creating a feasible application, we exported, cleaned, and visualized the data manually and stored them in Google Drive folders. Having these processes automated would save much time on our end and would allow for a more continuous upload of current health data. Another big addition we would like implemented would be uploading Epic EHRs into the application as it would provide a more robust overview of a patientâ€™s health.
