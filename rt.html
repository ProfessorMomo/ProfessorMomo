										<h3 class="major">Background on Ready Tensor</h3>

										<p>
											Ready Tensor Inc. is a machine learning (ML) startup that provides a platform for users to create, edit, and share different
											machine learning models. Users may also download these models which are containerized using Docker which makes them deployable in production settings.
											More information about the company can be found <a href = https://beta.readytensor.com/home target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here</a>. 

										</p>

										<h3 class="major">My Contribution</h3>

										<p>

											During my internship at Ready Tensor, I was responsible for creating a library of containerized machine learning models for two catrgories: binary classification and text
											classification. To be precise, a binary classification algorithm determines whether or not an observation belongs in either one of two classes
											(i.e. if a cell phone is either an Apple or an Android based on some features of the phone). A text classification algorithm is simply the categorization of 
											a corpus of text into a specific category (i.e. would this review be considered a good, bad, or neutral review). The purpose of this library
											is to provide contributing users with a baseline benchmark by which to measure their own models against. 

										
											<br>
											<br>

											I then was tasked with researching the different
											types of algorithms for each category I was assigned. Listed below are some of the algorithms and tools used to create the library of machine learning models

											Each algorithm I created had to fit within the specified Ready Tensor framework. This included
											providing a data cleaning pipeline, hyperparameter tuning, and a model evaluation output in the Docker
											container. So I used a variety of datasets to ensure that the cleaning pipeline was working
											as intended as well as evaluate how well the model would perform. If no issues arose, these algorithms would then be
											uploaded to the platform. 
																										
											
										</p>

										<h3 class="major">Final Result</h3>

										<p>
											After 3 months of creating and refining ML models, the two other interns and I were able to create a library of over 50 
											industry deployable ML models.
										</p>

										<h3 class="major">Future Expansions</h3>

										<p>
											As a whole, the project was a success and provided a great starting point for future iterations and improvements. One big improvement we would like to see made going forward would be the automating of the data loading and transformation process. For the sake of this project and creating a feasible application, we exported, cleaned, and visualized the data manually and stored them in Google Drive folders. Having these processes automated would save much time on our end and would allow for a more continuous upload of current health data. Another big addition we would like implemented would be uploading Epic EHRs into the application as it would provide a more robust overview of a patientâ€™s health.
