										<h3 class="major">Background on Ready Tensor</h3>

										<p>
											Ready Tensor Inc. is a machine learning (ML) startup that provides a platform for users to create, edit, and share different
											machine learning models. Users may also download these models which are containerized using Docker which makes them deployable in production settings.
											More information about the company can be found <a href = https://beta.readytensor.com/home> here</a>. 

										</p>

										<h3 class="major">Development</h3>

										<p>

											The team tasked with creating this dashboard consisted of myself and six other data science students working alongside our mentor, Dr. Benjamin Smarr, as well as a team of 4 bioengineering students. The data science side split ourselves up into two subteams: a backend team and a frontend team. The backend team was responsible for finding the APIs that would allow us to extract the data from the specific data source as well as creating a processing pipeline that would allow for the information to be displayed easily on the application. The frontend team (which was the team I was a part of) was responsible for the user interface of the application as well as creating the visualizations that displayed the useful health information of the patient. 
											
											<br>
											<br>
								
											The first part of the project was to interview Project Apollo, the group of individuals that proposed the project in the first place. In the interviews, we learned that Project Apollo members were very adamant about overlaying personal life events on top of their personal health data over a period of time as they wanted to see how they would affect their health in the long run. The members of Project Apollo also used Oura Rings to keep track of their health metrics such as sleep score, heart rate, and calories burned. So the backend teamâ€™s task was to be able to pull out the Oura Ring data and process it in a manner that allows it to be displayed on the application. The front end was tasked with finding an appropriate software to display the backend teamâ€™s cleaned data and an application that could host the visualizations. 
											
											<br>
											<br>

											Using the proprietary Oura API and packages such as Pandas and Numpy, the backend team was able to extract, transform, and load the Oura data into comma separated value files (CSVs) and store them on a Google Drive. We combined this data with Apple Health data that the bioengineering team was able to extract using the Apple Health API. The frontend team decided to use Tableau as our visualization tool of choice because not only are the graphs very easy to view, but also allow for comments and annotations on the graphs which can be used to document significant life events as per Project Apolloâ€™s request.
											These visualizations would be hosted on a website built using Github pages due to its ability for multiple users to work on the website simultaneously as well as it being free (we are college students after all ðŸ™‚).
											

										</p>

										<h3 class="major">Results</h3>

										<p>After 20 weeks of hard work and late nights, our Longitudinal Integrative Graphical Medical Application was completed. It features five different visualizations that include a Pearson correlation chart that allows the user to see how similar two of the metrics are to one another. We have also linked resources for the user on health information such as diet and sleep to provide them with resources concerning general health. We presented our application at our Data Science Showcase in which many industry professionals and professors inquired about our projects and its impact. 
										</p>

										<h3 class="major">Future Expansions</h3>

										<p>
											As a whole, the project was a success and provided a great starting point for future iterations and improvements. One big improvement we would like to see made going forward would be the automating of the data loading and transformation process. For the sake of this project and creating a feasible application, we exported, cleaned, and visualized the data manually and stored them in Google Drive folders. Having these processes automated would save much time on our end and would allow for a more continuous upload of current health data. Another big addition we would like implemented would be uploading Epic EHRs into the application as it would provide a more robust overview of a patientâ€™s health.
